The **KaririCode Framework** is a set of PHP components designed to provide a modular, secure, and efficient foundation, ideal for developing corporate solutions. Each module in the framework is built around solid coding principles such as high cohesion, low coupling, and extensibility, offering a reliable and scalable structure.

## About the Framework

The KaririCode Framework is developed to meet the demands of modern corporate development, with a focus on modularity, flexibility, and robustness. Each component is independent, allowing it to be used individually or integrated into more complex systems while maintaining code clarity and maintainability. The framework facilitates integration with third-party libraries by adhering to widely accepted design patterns.
